# hello-world
hello! we all crawl in the beginning... no, I scooted -- dyslexic I am

I got a little ahead of myself in that I've already revealed a bit about myself in the master branch.
I will add that I am a guitar player in addition to programming and that is the "guit" in my github
user name.  guitknurd == guitar drunk if you will (one of the first uses of the term "nerd" was "knurd".
referring to a "square" [this was the 1950's after all] that did not drunk booze -- an anti-cool non-hipcat.)

## adding one of these

so, this is a sentence added locally on Ravi that I hope to push back onto the
github site after I commit the addition of this text.

adding more text to get "git remote origin" syntax working.  is is working?

## add another one of these

I was going to remove the Ravi added text but a voice in the back of my head said, "NO!!"
so I didn't...
